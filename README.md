# TrafficAssignment

- Developed a static traffic assignment model at user equilibrium, usable with travel demand data from city networks across the world.
- Improved the performance by employing various strategies including Newton's method for root solution, vectorization of data structures
- Created toll maximization strategies for the Sioux Falls network to optimise the total revenue collection from the city while minimizing total system travel time
